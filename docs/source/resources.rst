Project resources: where to find them
=========================================================

This page provides a list of resources related to the Seshat project, what they are and where to find them.
This includes publications, code repositories, datasets, websites and shared drives.

Seshat websites explained
-------------------------

1. `seshat-db.com <https://seshat-db.com>`_ is the Seshat data website.

    - Here you can log in as an admin, researcher, Seshat expert or public user to access Seshat data via the website or API.

    - This site is managed by the Seshat Databank Admins; primarily Majid Benam. See the `team <team.rst>`_ page for more info.

2. `seshatdata.com <https://seshatdata.com>`_ is a test website which looks and behaves like the Seshat data website, but is used for testing new features before they are deployed to the main website.

3. `seshatdatabank.info <https://seshatdatabank.info>`_ is the project information website.

    - This provides external facing information about the Seshat project, its goals, and the team behind it.

    - This site is managed by Elizabeth Hempstead at the University of Oxford. Contact Pieter Francois to make changes to this site. See the `team <team.rst>`_ page for more info.

The Seshat project has it's own organisation on GitHub at `github.com/Seshat-Global-History-Databank <https://github.com/Seshat-Global-History-Databank>`_.
Here you can find public repositories for the Seshat website and documenatation, the Seshat API Python package and the Cliopatria dataset.

There is a second GitHub organisation at `github.com/seshatdb <https://github.com/seshatdb>`_ which contains some repositories containing data and/or scripts for generating data for Seshat publications and data downloads (see below).

.. note::

    - For more information on the using Seshat website codbase, see the `Seshat Databank Admin <admin/index.rst>`_ pages.
    - For more information on using the Seshat API python package and the Cliopatria dataset, see the `Researcher <researcher/index.rst>`_ pages.


Data downloads & code
-----------------------

Navigate to the `Replication datasets <researcher/datasets.rst>`_ page for a list of datasets associated with the Seshat project, download links and links to code repositories that can reproduce the methodology used to generate the data downloads.

Navigate to the `Analysis code <researcher/projects.rst>`_ page for a list of Seshat projects which include re-usable anaylysis scripts hosted on GitHub, Zenodo and OSF.

Methods and codebook
--------------------

The `project information website <https://seshatdatabank.info/methods/world-sample-30>`_ contains information on the methods used to collect and encode data for the Seshat Global History Databank.
