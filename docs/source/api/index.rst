API Reference
=============

You can access (and download) the latest Seshat data from the website using the Seshat API (Application Programming Interface).

The advantage of the API is that it allows you to access up-to-date Seshat data programmatically, allowing you to work with this data on your computer in a programming language such as Python.

The best way to get started with loading data via the Seshat API is to use our Python package. See :ref:`API Getting Started`.

.. note::

    - The Seshat API is a RESTful API that allows you to query the Seshat database and retrieve data in JSON format.
    - It is available on the Seshat website at `seshat-db.com/api <https://seshat-db.com/api/>`_. 
    - Loading the API in your browser will show you the available endpoints and the data that can be retrieved from them.
    - There is a filter option that allows you to specify the data you want to retrieve from the API.

The rest of this section og the documentation contains auto-generated API reference documentation.
