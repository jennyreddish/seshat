Seshat Databank Admin
=====================

This section of the documentation is for the Seshat Databank Admins: members of the Seshat team responsible for the maintenance and development of the Seshat codebase, database and website.

If you are new to the Seshat project, you should review these pages, in particular the Getting Started section of the Developers Guide.

You may also wish to review the `team <../team.rst>`_ page, which includes a help section, to see who on the Seshat team can help you with various tasks.
