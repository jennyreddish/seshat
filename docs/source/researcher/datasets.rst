Seshat datasets
===============

Data downloads (snapshots)
--------------------------

A list of datasets associated with the Seshat project and download links is maintained on the Seshat website at `seshat-db.com/downloads_page <https://seshat-db.com/downloads_page>`_.

These datasets are available for download in (typically) CSV format, and are the data used for research in associated academic publications. 

Data cleaning code
-----------------

Here we list the code repositories that can reproduce the methodology used to generate the data downloads.
This code includes R and Python scripts for cleaning and processing the raw data.
In some cases, this involves pulling data from the Seshat API, meaning the datasets can be updated with the latest data from the Seshat database.
